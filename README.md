# SteamAPIEngine

This project aims at creating an Online Engine built on top of the Steamworks API.
It will provide methods and flows to create lobbies, invite friends and exchange objects over the network protocols provided by the Steamworks API.

Dear ImGui is used to build debug menus and SFML is used to create the main window, and the steam overlay is integrated directly without any required work.
